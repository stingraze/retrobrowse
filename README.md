![Sigmarion 3 running retrobrowse (canary version, index10.php)](https://github.com/stingraze/retrobrowse/blob/main/sigmarion3-nytimes-world0.jpg)

This PHP script allows modern sites (like nvidia.com, nytimes.com ) etc. to load in a minimum format. (Almost all text, some images) 

This is useful to use with old PDAs and devices with small RAM size.
The latest release is index.php

Update:8/5/2024 13:10PM JST:
C:Amie at HPC:Factor has been kind enough to contribute some code to make it work on a Windows environment.
I have not personally tested it, but it is under windows directory.

Update: 8/6/2024 11:43PM JST:
I have made the C:Amie's edited version and mine the same (index.php) You will need .htaccess for user authentication in this Ver. 0.11.

Tested to work on PHP 8.0 & PHP 8.3.9 on Ubuntu 20.04
