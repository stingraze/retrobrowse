![Sigmarion 3 running retrobrowse (canary version, index10.php)](https://github.com/stingraze/retrobrowse/blob/main/sigmarion3-nytimes-world0.jpg)

This PHP script allows modern sites (like nvidia.com, nytimes.com ) etc. to load in a minimum format. (Almost all text, some images) 

This is useful to use with old PDAs and devices with small RAM size.
The latest release is under canary, index10.php

Tested to work on PHP 8.0 on Ubuntu 20.04
